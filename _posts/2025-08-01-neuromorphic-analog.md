Summary
------

üßê Making use of the rich analog properties of the underlying physics of computation might be a base of future AI compute of >100x efficiency gain.

üßê Such path needs to be taken with much caution, be mindful about the key principle of making artificial intelligence: model needs to be able to be copied with ease (i.e., software-hardware separatable, or hardware variations should be controllable or trackable).

üßê Efforts of two sides needs to be taken: on hardware, start accumulating technology and ecosystems of analog computing necessary and principled by AI compute; on algorithm, understand how algorithms can make use of the analog properties of the underlying physics of computation without modeling it accurately, like how bio neuro systems works.
