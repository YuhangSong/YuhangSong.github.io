My interest is to decipher and extract the learning principles of biological neural systems, so as to reverse-engineer them as algorithms or even specialized hardware. Such a route of research would, on the one hand, bring us one step closer to true artificial intelligence (as our attempt in [Fractile](https://www.fractile.ai/)), and, on the other hand, improve our understanding (as our attempt in [the N.N. paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01514-1)) of the most sophisticated part of our body, the brain.

Bio
=======

<!-- (10 awardees worldwide) -->
I obtained my doctoral degree in Computer Science & Neuroscience from Oxford University, where I was awarded [J.P. Morgan AI Research Award](https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/research-awards) for my work in identifying learning principles originating from biological neurons. During this time, with [a group of amazing scientists](https://www.mrcbndu.ox.ac.uk/groups/bogacz-group), I first-authored [a Nature Neuroscience paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01514-1) and some AI/ML conference papers ([detailed in CV](http://yuhangsong.github.io/files/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf)). My research inspires 100x more efficient hardware for artificial neural networks, turning into a spinout from Oxford University: [Fractile](https://www.fractile.ai/). I am fortunate to cofound it with [Walter Goodwin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/walter-goodwin/) in 2021. Fractile [raised $15M](https://fortune.com/2024/07/26/fractile-ai-chip-startup-nvidia-15-million-funding-seed-round/) over two years and I exited from it afterwards to pursue my next adventure.
