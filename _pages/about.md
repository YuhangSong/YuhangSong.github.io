My interest is to decipher learning principles of biological neurons, so as to reverse-engineer them as algorithms or specialized hardware. Such a route would, on the one hand, bring us one step closer to ultra efficient machine intelligence (as our attempt in [Fractile](https://www.fractile.ai/)); on the other hand, improve our understanding of the most sophisticated part of our body, the brain (as our attempt in [the N.N. paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01514-1)).

Bio
=======

<!-- (10 awardees worldwide) -->
I obtained my doctoral degree in Computer Science & Neuroscience from Oxford University, where I was awarded [J.P. Morgan AI Research Award](https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/research-awards) for identifying a family of learning principles from biological neurons. During this time, with [a group of amazing scientists](https://www.mrcbndu.ox.ac.uk/groups/bogacz-group), I first-authored [a Nature Neuroscience paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01514-1) and some AI/ML conference papers ([detailed in CV](http://yuhangsong.github.io/files/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf)). My research inspires 100x more efficient hardware for artificial neural networks, turning into a spinout from Oxford University: [Fractile](https://www.fractile.ai/). I am fortunate to team up with [Walter Goodwin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/walter-goodwin/) and cofound it in 2021. Fractile [raised $15M](https://fortune.com/2024/07/26/fractile-ai-chip-startup-nvidia-15-million-funding-seed-round/) over two years and I exited from it afterwards to pursue my next adventure.
