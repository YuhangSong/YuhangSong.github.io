with an aim of discovering and understanding the fundamental elements of intelligence, so as to build the next-generation learning systems (for the next 10+ years 🚀).

<!-- Such a route would, on the one hand, bring us one step closer to the true machine intelligence (as our attempt in [Fractile](https://www.fractile.ai/)); on the other hand, improve our understanding of the most sophisticated part of our body, the brain (as our attempt in [the _Nature Neuroscience_ paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01514-1)). -->

<!-- in Computer Science & Neuroscience -->

I obtained my PhD from Oxford University, where I was awarded [J.P. Morgan AI Research Award](https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/research-awards) for identifying a family of learning principles from biological neurons (10 awardees worldwide). During this time, with [a group of amazing scientists](https://www.mrcbndu.ox.ac.uk/groups/bogacz-group), I first-authored [a _Nature Neuroscience_ paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01514-1) and some AI/ML conference papers ([detailed in CV](http://yuhangsong.github.io/files/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf)).

My research is presented in [the Nature Portfolio collection of Nobel Prize in Physics 2024](https://www.nature.com/collections/ehbjaifcgc) and extensively discussed in [a recent article on _The Economist_](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2024/08/14/ai-scientists-are-producing-new-theories-of-how-the-brain-learns).

<!-- "Other researchers are exploring rather different theories. In a paper published in _Nature Neuroscience_ earlier this year, Yuhang Song and colleagues at Oxford University..." -->

My research inspires 100x more efficient hardware for artificial neural networks, turning into a spinout from Oxford University: [Fractile](https://www.fractile.ai/). I am fortunate to team up with [Walter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/walter-goodwin/) and cofound it in 2021 as the CTO. Fractile [raised a total of $17.5M (约1.2亿人民币) from various VCs](https://fortune.com/2024/07/26/fractile-ai-chip-startup-nvidia-15-million-funding-seed-round/) and [$6.3M (约4500万) from ARIA](https://www.businessweekly.co.uk/posts/fractile-on-song-as-aria-awards-ps5m-to-ai-chip-design-pioneer) over 2021-2024 and I left Fractile in 2024 to pursue my next venture. In 2025, former Intel CEO, Pat Gelsinger, [invested and joined Fractile](https://thetechcapital.com/former-intel-ceo-backs-uk-ai-startup-fractile-to-boost-llm-inference/).

I cofound [Circlemind](https://circlemind.co) with [Antonio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonio-vespoli-895727121/) and [Luca](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luca-pinchetti-414230222/) in 2024. Circlemind is [backed by YC at F24 batch](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/circlemind). I left Circlemind in 2025.

<!-- I am currently an independent researcher. -->

In 2025, I am funded by “National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars (海外优青)”, joining [School of Artificial Intelligence (人工智能学院)](https://ai.nju.edu.cn) at the [Nanjing University (南京大学)](https://www.nju.edu.cn), as Associate Professor (Pre-Tenure).

我的研究是破译生物神经的学习原理，并将其逆向工程为新型算法或专用硬件。这一方向让我们离真正的机器智能更近一步（如我们在[Fractile](https://www.fractile.ai/)中的尝试），也推动我们对大脑这一最复杂器官的深入理解（如我们在[_Nature Neuroscience_文章](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01514-1)中的尝试）。

简介
======

我在牛津大学获得博士学位，因发现一系列生物神经的学习原理获[摩根大通人工智能研究奖](https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/research-awards)（全球每年10名获奖者）。期间，与[一群卓越的科学家](https://www.mrcbndu.ox.ac.uk/groups/bogacz-group), 我以第一作者发表了[一篇_Nature Neuroscience_文章](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01514-1) 和一些人工智能会议文章 ([详见CV](http://yuhangsong.github.io/files/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf))。

我的研究在[Nature Portfolio发布的2024年诺贝尔物理学奖合集](https://www.nature.com/collections/ehbjaifcgc)中被报道，并且在[最近《_经济学人_》的一篇报道](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2024/08/14/ai-scientists-are-producing-new-theories-of-how-the-brain-learns)中被深入讨论。

我的研究启发了比传统GPU能效高100倍的硬件范式, 并从牛津大学拆分初创公司: [Fractile](https://www.fractile.ai/)。我很荣幸与[Walter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/walter-goodwin/)在2021年一起成立Fractile，并担任CTO。2021到2024年间，Fractile[从多家风投融资合1.2亿人民币](https://fortune.com/2024/07/26/fractile-ai-chip-startup-nvidia-15-million-funding-seed-round/)并[受到英国政府资助合5800万人民币](https://www.businessweekly.co.uk/posts/fractile-on-song-as-aria-awards-ps5m-to-ai-chip-design-pioneer)。我于2024年退出Fractile。

2024年，我和[Antonio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonio-vespoli-895727121/)及[Luca](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luca-pinchetti-414230222/)一起成立初创公司[Circlemind](https://circlemind.co)。Circlemind[受到YC在2024秋季批次的投资](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/circlemind)。 -->
