Hi! I’m Yuhang. I obtained my doctoral degree in Computer Science & Neuroscience from Oxford University, where I was awarded [J.P. Morgan AI Research Award](https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/research-awards) (10 awardees worldwide) for my work in identifying learning principles originating from biological neurons. At the time, I first-authored [a Nature Neuroscience paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01514-1) and some AI/ML conference papers ([academic CV](https://sites.google.com/view/yuhangsong)). My research inspires 100x more efficient specialized silicon chips for AI, turning into a spinout from Oxford University: [Fractile](https://www.fractile.ai/). I cofounded Fractile in 2021, very fortunately with [Walter Goodwin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/walter-goodwin/). We [raised $15M](https://fortune.com/2024/07/26/fractile-ai-chip-startup-nvidia-15-million-funding-seed-round/) over two years and I exited from it in 2024.

My interest is to decipher and extract the learning principles of biological neural systems, so as to reverse-
engineer them as algorithms or even specialized hardware. Such a route of research would, on the one hand,
bring us one step closer to true artificial intelligence (as our attempt in [Fractile](https://www.fractile.ai/)), and, on the other hand, improve our understanding (as our attempt in [the N.N. paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01514-1))
of the most sophisticated part of our body, the brain, so that diseases related to learning, and broadly, to
neural systems, can be better understood and treated.
