I picked up freestyle skiing and tennis in 2024, and they are my main passion now, aside with my research.
I used to be super into badminton, played over 10+ years, and used to play for Oxford University second men's team (at the bottom of the league though).

I believe life and work deserve the same fire. So I chase joy in the code, on the court, and through the slopes and mountains.

See below my recent freestyle skiing showoff â€” humblebrag included.
