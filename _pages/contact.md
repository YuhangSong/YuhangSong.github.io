I prefer talking over typing (due to eye pressure problem), so if you got a long email to write, consider scheduling a call with the below Calendly link instead.

If you are a perspective student, include the following materials in your email:
- CV
- Transcript
- If you have won any competition awards, please send the official documents (such as certificates or official announcements) for those you consider the most significant (include those in high school). If any of the materials are in a language other than English or Chinese, please include both the original and a translated version.
