‚úâÔ∏è E-mail: dr.yuhang.song [at] gmail.com

üí¨ I prefer talking over typing, so if you got a long email to write, consider [schedule a call/meet-up with me](https://calendar.app.google/hht4fM1at5AGyhXD8).

## Students

If you are a perspective student, include the following materials in your email:
- CV
- Transcript
- If you have won any competition awards, please send the official documents (such as certificates or official announcements) for those you consider the most significant (include those in high school). If any of the materials are in a language other than English or Chinese, please include both the original and a translated version.
- I sometimes ask where you had your high school for reference, so I suggest including such information as well.
